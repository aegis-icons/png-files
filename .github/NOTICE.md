As of 2021-07-25, PNG files are not actively made **unless someone reports rendering issues** with SVG counterpart ([info](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/issues/240#issuecomment-884841536)).

If you are still using Aegis v1.4.2 or older, please **upgrade to Aegis v2.0.1 or newer** to take advantage of [icon pack feature](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/FAQ.md#with-icon-pack) and smaller export file sizes with SVG icons.
